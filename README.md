- Missing footnotes, esp in books (², ³, etc.)

**Clean up**:

**Improvements**:
- thyroid-hormones.md is too long - should probably be split into 2/3 files

- *Articles*:
  - Only one h1 (#) heading per article - the title
  - Title always at the very top
  - Every other heading is h2 (##) except for nested headings
  - No extra formatting (bold, italics, etc.) on headings
  - References at the bottom preceded with a dash (-)
  - Each paragraph/heading/reference separated by one line break
