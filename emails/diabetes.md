# Diabetes

Diabetics typically have elevated lactate, which shows that glucose doesn't have a problem getting into their cells, just getting oxidized. Sugars, if they are consumed in quantities beyond the ability to metabolize them (and that easily happens in the presence of PUFA) are converted into saturated fatty acids, which have antistress, antiinflammatory effects. Many propaganda experiments are set up, feeding a grossly excessive amount of polyunsaturated fat, causing sugar to form fat, specifically so they can publish their silly diet recommendations, which supposedly explain the obesity epidemic, but the government figures I cited show that vegetable fat consumption has increased, sugar hasn't. My articles have a lot of information on the mechanisms, such as the so-called 'Randle cycle,' in which fatty acids shut down the ability to oxidize sugar. Polyunsaturated fats do many things that increase blood sugar inappropriately, and my articles review several of the major mechanisms.Several years ago, medical people started talking about the harmful effects of insulin, such as stimulating fat production, so 'insulin resistance' which keeps a high level of insulin from producing obesity would seem to be a good thing, but the medical obesity culture really isn't thinking very straight. One factor in the 'insulin resistance' created by PUFA involves estrogen---chronic accumulation of PUFA in the tissues increases the production of estrogen, and the polyunsaturated free fatty acids intensify the actions of estrogen, which acts in several ways to interfere with glucose oxidation.

The T3 component of the thyroid hormone makes muscles and other tissues oxidize sugar. Calcium, sodium, and aspirin are other things that increase the ability to use glucose.

Free fatty acids are usually high in diabetes, and interfere with glucose use. Aspirin and niacinamide help to lower stress increased fatty acids, so allow exercised muscles to use more glucose. 2 or 3 mcg of cynomel with some food should help to avoid the adrenaline. Vitamins D and K, and salt and calcium, are other things that improve glucose use. Since the liver needs glucose and glycogen to convert T4 into T3, diabetes usually interferes with the conversion. A blood test could show if the ratio of T4 to T3 is very high.

## Diabetes Type 1 / Beta Cell Regeneration

Starches and polyunsaturated fats keep stressing beta cells as they regenerate. Endotoxin and nitric oxide cause insulin resistance, besides being toxic to the beta cells, so it's essential to keep the small intestine relatively free of bacteria. A daily raw carrot salad is helpful; well cooked mushrooms every day can help in a veriety of ways.

I have known people who believed they had insulin deficiency, who recovered completely. The pancreas beta cells can regenerate quickly, polyunsaturated fats are continually damaging them.

Pregnenolone does convert to either DHEA or progesterone. Sugar and brewer's yeast are other things that help with the regeneration. Keeping free fatty acids low is important, and niacinamide could help with that.

Glucose stimulates regeneration, and pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA help to keep them alive. Thyroid and good nutrition gradually help to detoxify the stored fats that are responsible for killing them. Aspirin and niacinamide help in different ways.

There are several articles relating to diabetes on my website. Polyunsaturated fats damage the pancreas and increase stress hormones, while glucose stimulates the renewal of insulin-secreting cells. Fruits provide minerals that help to regulate glucose metaboiism, and help to regulate thyroid function.

## Blood Sugar Control

Vitamin B1 helps to oxidize glucose, so if you try 50 or 100 mg with a meal you should watch for possible hypoglycemia from the insulin. Pantothenic acid is safe in doses of 100 or 200 mg, and helps to limit hypoglycemia. Brewers' yeast has other nutrients that help with repairing the pancreas, but can cause gas, so it's best to start by pouring hot water over an ounce or two of it, and using just the liquid.

Aspirin helps to increase the oxidation of glucose, reinforcing the effects of thyroid hormone. It can antagonize vitamin K, potentially increasing a bleeding tendency, but with a supplement of K it's safe to test the effects of a standard 5 grain tablet with a meal twice a day, to see if it helps to prevent hyperglycemia. The cynoplus should start with a sixth of a tablet per day, watching for effects during the first two weeks. Too much could raise blood sugar rather than regulating it; I hope no one is suggesting beginning with a whole tablet per day. The appropriate amount of progesterone depends on the need and time of month. Vitamin B1 helps to oxidize glucose, so its use should be adjusted according to need.

I think it's valuable to have a blood test for vitamin D to regulate the dose; TSH can be useful, too, but it's very important to check your temperature and pulse rate regularly to judge the effects of a thyroid supplement, since the need for it varies with season and type of activity. Has your cortisol been checked occasionally? I think it's common for kids to be diagnosed as diabetic when they have high blood sugar following a sickness such as flu; insulin treatment can institutionalize an over-production of the stress hormones. Inflammation of the intestine (which can start with an infection) can be sustained by undigested starches, and the resulting endotoxin/nitric oxide/serotonin can cause insulin resistance, so it's important to keep the small intestine relatively germ-free. Melons and potatoes can feed bacteria if they are present. Adequate calcium is extremely important, because of the interactions of parathyroid hormone and serotonin with stress and glucose metabolism.

Daily protein should be at least 80 grams, and fruit should provide a large part of the calories. A little vitamin B6 (10 mg) can help with amino acid metabolism.
