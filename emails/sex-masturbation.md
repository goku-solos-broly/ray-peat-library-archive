# Sex and Masturbation

High estrogen does sometimes cause insatiable sexual interest, partly because it increases adrenal androgens, and partly by inhibiting satisfying orgasms. Too much progesterone can suppress or neutralize the androgens. Thyroid is the best way to regulate the system, keeping libido up, making orgasms satisfying.

## Does masturbation or sex have positive or negative effects on the hormones or stress?
Generally positive, but intense arousal can have unwanted consequences, such as herpes virus outbreaks.

## Masturbation: effect on prolactin
I don't think masturbation affects the hormones more than regular sex does.
