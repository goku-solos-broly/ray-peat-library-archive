# Teenagers & Puberty

Around puberty the changing hormones, especially momentarily high estrogen in boys, can cause some obsessive episodes, and I suppose stress could be involved with early high testosterone production. A few small supplementations with thyroid or pregnenolone might reduce the stress and extend his growing years, but he could judge by whether it made him feel better. Lots of milk and fruit are appropriate in the teens, with eggs, seafoods, and meats according to appetite.

## Cynoplus & Retin-A/Retinoids for Teenager
An eighth or tenth of a cynoplus tablet is a good amount for a trial, it's a little less than the body would normally produce in an hour, so it's enough to detect as a change of state, slight change of heart rate, warming of hands, for example. Vitamin A is such a basic metabolic factor, in the brain and endocrine glands, liver and kidneys, etc., I think it's dangerous to experiment with drugs that interfere with it.
