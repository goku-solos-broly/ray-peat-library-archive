# Testosterone

## TESTOSTERONE SUPPLEMENTATION
Yes, pure testosterone on the skin is safe if the diet and thyroid function are good, but it's better to try supplements of pregnenolone first, and then DHEA, to normalize the testosterone production.

## LOW TESTOSTERONE: Would the addition of topical testosterone supplement work in the same direction as the diet and thyroid supplement?
Yes, I think a small supplement of testosterone will work in the same direction.

## Shrunken testes from use of high doses exogenous testosterone/DHT
Testosterone and DHT aren't toxic, so the testes probably haven't been damaged, and would resume functioning with good nutritional support. 100 mg of pregnenolone and 5 mg of DHEA would probably help their recovery, but I think it would be good to have your LH and estrogen checked. If the LH is very high, using a little DHT for a while might be protective until it's more normal. Coffee, aspirin, vitamin D, milk and cheese would also protect against high LH.

## TESTOSTERONE INJECTION
I think an oil or cream with real testosterone (and DHEA) is much better than the injections, which are usually an ester of testosterone in a toxic solvent.
