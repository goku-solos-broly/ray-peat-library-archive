# Antiserotonin Drugs

**[Cyproheptadine]**
I think cyproheptadine is a safe antiserotonin drug [serotonin syndrome].

**[Mirtazapine]**
I think its antiserotonin effects might be helpful, but I haven't tried it myself.

**[Tianeptine]**
I have known a few people who had very good results with tianeptine, and a couple who got side effects from it. I think any of the antiserotonin drugs will eventually cause side effects, and should only be used until a problem is corrected, for example when an enlarged pituitary is normalized. I think the same effects can be produced with nutrition and hormones, without the possible problems. 

**[Can anti-serotonin drugs permanently fix a problem, even if taken only for a short while?]**
Yes, but it's important to keep adjusting thyroid and progesterone according to temperature, pulse, etc.

Thyroid is the best thing for controlling serotonin's effects. The drugs that act on "receptors" act simultaneously on many things; one effect of some of them is a selective "agonist" effect on the "receptor" which is involved in negative feedback, turning off the cells that produce serotonin. Wikipedia is a function of consensus; according to them, serotonin is a happy hormone, and there are no conspiracies of government officials and bankers.

[Ritanserin]
I haven't had any experience with ritanserin, don't recommend it, and don't recall discussing it.
