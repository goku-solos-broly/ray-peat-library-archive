# Serotonin

## SSRIs causing gut problems
The gut makes 95% of serotonin, which is the main promoter of stress hormones, inflammation, pain, and anxiety.

Serum serotonin fluctuates according to intestinal irritation, but for the average to change very much it's necessary for the liver and brain to adapt, and that usually takes a few months. Since the lungs are the main site of serotonin metabolism, an air ionizer near your bed can help.

B6 helps for turning tryptophan into niacin rather than serotonin.

## Lower serotonin leading to holism
Yes, it allows a positive kind of mental energy, since high serotonin causes conservative, defensive authoritarian avoidance.

Effective mental effort is easier to make when serotonin isn't excessive; attitude and chemistry interact, both directions.

Some people who haven't had ideal results from bromocriptine have had better results from tianeptine, and/or lisuride, and/or cyproheptadine [anti-serotonin drugs].

Cyproheptadine might be helpful for reducing sensitivity to intestinal irritants.

## Can anti-serotonin drugs permanently fix a problem, even if taken only for a short while?
Yes, but it's important to keep adjusting thyroid and progesterone according to temperature, pulse, etc.

Thyroid is the best thing for controlling serotonin's effects. The drugs that act on "receptors" act simultaneously on many things; one effect of some of them is a selective "agonist" effect on the "receptor" which is involved in negative feedback, turning off the cells that produce serotonin. Wikipedia is a function of consensus; according to them, serotonin is a happy hormone, and there are no conspiracies of government officials and bankers.

## High serotonin
It's important to know how it was measured, and what your platelet count was. Is your intestine inflamed? Since serotonin affects bone metabolism, have your serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D3, prolactin, and cortisol been measured?

I don't think doctors know what to do for regulating serotonin. Vitamin B6 helps to direct tryptophan toward niacinamide, away from serotonin. Gelatin contains no tryptophan, so things like consomme can be helpful. Raw carrots, because of their antiseptic effect, help to lower irritation and bloating. Antibiotics can be helpful, when the small intestine is overgrown with bacteria. Thyroid supplementation will lower cholesterol. Some people get very sleepy with just two milligrams of Periactin, so I think it's good to start with one mg. the first night. Two milligrams can make a big difference, and when symptoms stop the effects can last for days without using it.
