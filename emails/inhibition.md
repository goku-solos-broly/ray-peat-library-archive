# Inhibition

Inhibition occurs when the proteins are in a relatively acidic (electron-withdrawn, electronegative) state, because of the conditioning factors, including high ATP, CO2, and ketone and quinone groups associated with them, and the relative exclusion of disordering groups and ions, such as hydroxyls, phosphate, and sodium.
