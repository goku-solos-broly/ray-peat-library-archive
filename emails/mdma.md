In pure form and moderate dose (e.g., 1 to 1.5 mg per kg body weight), I think it's likely to be helpful for changing the pattern of chronic stress/learned helplessness, and maybe the chronic degenerative diseases produced by inescapable stress. The production of nitric oxide is likely to be a problem with large doses or chronic use.
