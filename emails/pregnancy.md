# Pregnancy

**[Should any of these be avoided during pregnancy: Cynoplus, pregnenolone, vitamin K, topical vitamin D and A, niacinamide, vitamin B1 and B5, Progest E, coffee with milk and sugar?]**
No.

**[C-SECTION]**
C-sections, anesthesia, DES, and mechanical attitudes toward pregnancy and nutrition all have their place in the authoritarian medical culture, part of a generally stressful culture. That culture is coherent and self-validating, and escape from it has to be equally systematic to be able to persist.

**[NAUSEA]**
Salt is often the most important thing for pregnancy nausea. Two quarts of milk daily, cheese, eggs, and orange juice, but with anything salty, even sips of salty water first thing in the morning, should stop it. Low thyroid function, with a low ratio of progesterone to estrogen, causes the kidneys to be unable to retain salt efficiently.

## HYPOTHYRODISM DURING PREGNANCY, EFFECT ON OFFSPRING, TREATMENT IN THE 50s

I think a background of hypothyroidism, even when it's compensated by high production of the stress hormones so that the classical symptoms aren't present, is a major factor in reproductive problems, and in increasing susceptibility to injury by toxins, including DES and anesthetics. Progesterone production depends on good thyroid function, and as it declines cortisol and other stress hormones increase.

A few doctors at that time [1956] used real progesterone supplements during pregnancy, but generally they were much more likely to use a synthetic progestin, or DES or estrogen.

The prenatal environment can imprint a pattern of hormone balance, especially hypothyroidism, that tends to persist until new patterns can be formed, and that usually requires prolonged supplementation and a very good diet. With a good balance of nutrients and thyroid function, the protective progesterone, pregnenolone and DHEA are produced sufficiently to reduce the burden on the adrenal glands.

Gallbladder problems are extremely common in hypothyroidism [family history], and the compensating stress hormones produce problems with blood sugar regulation.

## ASPIRIN
Aspirin has a good record of safety in pregnancy, paracetamol doesn't. It became the most commonly used analgesic, displacing aspirin, because of advertising, not science.

Aspirin has been studied mainly in women with a tendency to miscarry or to develop preeclampsia, and it improved the health of their babies, but I don't know of any good animal studies that would involve a realistic intermittent use of larger doses.
