# DMSO

I got interested in it in 1965, after reading about Stanley Jacob's ideas, and experimented with it occasionally over the next several years. I was interested in its effects on cell water, stabilizing it in a way that reduces some kinds of inflammation. It seems to accelerate some enzyme reactions. I later started to think about its own chemical properties, rather than thinking of it as just a solvent. It isn't stable in the presence of water, and the odor seems to indicate the degree of its decomposition. It occasionally helps slightly with joint pain, but it can cause intense skin reactions, rashes; I think some of its effects depend on the breakdown products. People often forget that it has an intrinsic oxidative effect when they are thinking of it as just a solvent, to transport drugs. I saw a product sold as eye drops, consisting of vitamin C and glutathione in DMSO. Each of those reductants, in the presence of DMSO, immediately breaks down into other substances, and the composition changes continually over a long period. There has been very little investigation of the actual composition of solutions of DMSO with other substances. At least some of the mixtures will produce sulfite and metabisulfite, which are very allergenic for some people. 

Small amounts are probably harmless; even large amounts seem harmless for some people. Its ability to release histamine and nitric oxide and to inhibit cholinesterase (articles below) suggest that its use shouldn't be prolonged.

## Safety
In low concentrations DMSO is usually safe, but since I have seen allergy-like reactions to it, and since the biological chemisty is complex (e.g., J Phys Chem A. 2006 Jun 22;110(24):7628-36. Theoretical study of the reduction mechanism of sulfoxides by thiols. Balta B, Monard G, Ruiz-LÃ³pez MF, Antoine M, Gand A, Boschi-Muller S, Branlant G.), I think it's good to use it cautiously and watchfully.

## Joint pain
Thanks for the information; about 40 years ago I was interested in DMSO, but I lost interest in it when I saw some reactions like that.
