**[Overweight]**
Have you had a blood test for TSH and vitamin D? High TSH is often the main factor in high blood pressure, so it should be low. A deficiency of calcium or vitamin D can increase parathyroid hormone, increasing serum calcium and blood pressure. Drinking two quarts of low fat milk per day will help to lose weight and lower blood pressure.
