# Sleep

**[SLEEP APNEA]**
Several things have been very effective, for example the drug Diamox, acetazolamide, stimulates respiration by changing CO2 and pH; caffeine, thyroid, and progesterone are the more natural things that stimulate respiration.

Thyroid is the main regulatory and adaptive substance for respiration. I think it's common to call the apnea "obstructive" when someone is fat, but it's probably essentially the same condition, filtered through the mechanical medical mind.

**[ASPIRIN]**
It can help with sleep, but you should try it first in the afternoon, because sometimes its first effect can stimulate your metabolism and delay sleep. If you use it regularly, you should have some vitamin K (for example liver once a week).

**[Sleeping 10+ hours]**
If you wake up feeling refreshed, I think it's very good to now and then get some extra sleep. Under-sleeping increases nitric oxide, and catch-up sleep lowers it. Niacinamide, coffee, and aspirin are things that lower NO.
