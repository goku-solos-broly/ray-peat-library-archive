# Brain

**[Large Brain]**
It makes the body's glycogen stores more important, so thyroid function can benefit especially from avoidance of PUFA; coffee's protective effects, increasing metabolic efficiency, are probably especially helpful.

Regarding intelligence and a big head---the brain is energetically a very expensive organ in terms of its energy requirements, and the liver has to be very efficient to meet its needs, so when there is a nutritional or hormonal problem, the problems can be especially intense. Nutritional needs for sugar, protein, vitamins, and minerals can be very high.

**[Recovering from traumatic brain injury (concussions)]**
Pregnenolone and progesterone are the most important things for the after-effects of concussions. Pregnenolone, if it's pure, doesn't have any side effects, so it's safe in large doses. 100 mg per day is usually an effective amount (I took 3000 to 4000 mg per day for a year, with no side effects). Progesterone is usually helpful in moderate, physiological amounts, maybe 20 to 30 mg per day (with food), but more would be o.k. if the effects seem better. The frontal lobes of the brain are involved in focussing attention and planning, and these hormones stabilize the major frontal lobe nerves. Vitamin D and calcium are essential for the protective effects of these hormones, so it would be good to have a vitamin D blood test. Many people, when they don't get much direct sunlight exposure, need about 5000 i.u. of vitamin D3 per day to keep the blood level around the normal 50 ng/ml.
