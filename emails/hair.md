# Hair

Thyroid makes the hair strong, a high metabolic rate can create a static field that helps it to stand up.

## STRAIGHT HAIR FROM PROGESTERONE
Fast, vigorous hair growth tends to make it straighter (a rounder shaft).

Yes, topical aspirin and caffeine stimulate hair growth. 

## RESTORING HAIR COLOR
Do you know how your thyroid function is? Thyroid regulates copper assimilation, and also the hormones that regulate pigment.

I found that applying a weak solution of copper just once would restore color immediately to eyebrows, or to about 10% of sideburn hairs, apparently because the very long-lived hairs have to be in the right phase of growth, and eyebrows, with a very short life, seem to stay receptive to the stimulation. But I also found that a slightly too strong solution could cause a mole to develop almost instantly, with an invasion of pigment cells. I think a safer alternative would be to supplement, either topically or orally, a little DHEA.

## HAIR LOSS FROM PREGNENOLONE AND ASPIRIN POSSIBLE?
No.

## Is TOPICAL ASPIRIN useful for healthier hair? Does it cause water retention?
It doesn't cause water retention, and since prostaglandins are involved in atrophy of hair follicles, inhibiting prostaglandins locally could help.

## Topical thyroid (NDT) in a solution of DMSO and ethanol for male pattern baldness
Desiccated thyroid gland doesn't contain any free hormone; the gland contains thyroglobulin, a protein, which when digested releases the hormones.

## Alopecia Areata
Hypothyroidism is often a factor, and I think the "autoimmune" process is promoted by endotoxin and nitric oxide from bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine; a pregnenolone supplement can improve response to thyroid supplements. Well cooked mushrooms and bamboo shoots have antiinflammatory, antiseptic effects that can reduce inflammation and might reduce the stress-induced fat deposition. If you don't get regular sun exposure, vitamin D supplements might help.

## DANDRUFF
Vitamin A deficiency is a common cause of dandruff.
