# Teeth and Gums

**[Bleeding gums]**
It's usually a sign of stress, often from over-growth of bacteria in the upper intestine. A daily raw carrot, shredded with a little vinegar and olive oil, can suppress bacteria.

**[Receding gums and sensitive teeth]**
Melting a little coconut oil in the mouth frequently during the day can be effective, because it's antiseptic (and swallowing some at intervals during the day contributes to disinfecting the intestine). Vitamins D and K help some people. The problem usually involves endotoxin absorption, so small daily amounts of minocycline help some people. Putting bamboo shoots through a shredding food processor, so they don't take much chewing, might help to reduce endotoxin. Checking the thyroid is important.

**[Dental health]**
Stress weakens teeth from the inside, drawing mineral from the dentine; the dentine is the part that can regenerate, not the enamel. Thyroid function is the most important thing for limiting stress.

Stress typically causes calcium to be removed from the small channels in the dentine, and it tends to be unequal, resulting in spots of discoloration in some teeth, that can develop into cavities. Thyroid is the most important antistress hormone as well as influencing the saliva and immunity.

Intestinal inflammation is often behind recurrent tooth infections, and a daily raw carrot can make a big difference (along with avoiding legumes, undercooked starches and raw or undercooked vegetables). 

I use baking soda, and I rinse my mouth after having sugar, orange juice, etc. The quality of the saliva, regulated mainly by the thyroid hormone, is the main factor in dental health. My newsletter on osteoporosis mentioned some of the studies on thyroid, estrogen, and tooth decay. 

**[Tongue, teeth, gum problems]**
There are some strong nervous and circulatory interactions between the intestine and the mouth, affecting surfaces and periodontal health, tooth sensitivity, etc. I knew a dentist who stopped doing periodontal surgery when he found that his patients were more easily cured with a laxative. Camphoric acid has been used as an intestinal disinfectant to remedy problems such as coated or sore tongue or bad breath. The tetracyclines have similar effects. Vitamins D and K are important.

**[Question about regenerating teeth with light]**
Light can apparently activate part of the process; combining it with pressure and electrical and hormonal stimulation might increase the efficiency of regenerating dentine. [using a laser?] Just bright red light should do it. 

**[Effective stimulation?]**
Chewing is the best stimulation.

**[Gingivitis]**
Besides keeping phosphates low, getting a lot of vitamin K, and maybe rubbing some onto the gums, might help; it's antiinflammatory. Some people have reverse gingivitis by "rinsing" with coconut oil twice a day, swishing it around for a couple of minutes. 

**[Removing wisdom tooth]**
If it's decayed or inflamed, removing a wisdom tooth might be protective. 

**[Carrageenan in toothpaste]**
No, it isn't likely to be a problem unless you are very sensitive to it. 

**[Root canals]**
There's normally no need to replace root canals, and x-rays aren't necessary even when having a root canal done if the dentist is very competent. The Japanese are probably more aware than Americans of the damage done by diagnositic x-rays. Systemic toxic effects have been demonstrated from a single set of dental x-rays (Reference)

**[Mercury leaching from root canals continuously and replacing it with a metal / mercury-free alternative?]**
It depends on what the filling material was (my dentist used calcium oxide), but the amount absorbed from amalgam fillings and food is probably much more significant."

**[What is the best course of action for a decayed tooth?]**
I think any obvious cavity should be cleaned out and filled. Extractions are usually done for economic reasons, when a good repair would require a lot of work. When a biting surface isn't involved, a zinc oxide eugenol filling (temporary) is often good for a few years. I think composite fillings are better than amalgam, and the Sorel cements (oxy chloride) are ideal filling materials, though they aren't popular with dentists.

**[Drilling and filling cavities and root canals]**
I think filling a cavity soon is best, and with care the pulp can often be preserved, but a root filling is better than extraction; the material used for a root filling doesn't matter much, if calcium oxide is used at the end. Calcium oxide would be best for the whole thing, but the x-ray mania has discouraged that use.

**[Milk teeth]**
I don't think anesthesia should be combined with cyproheptadine, but I think dentists are too aggressive in treating deciduous teeth; the important thing is to improve her digestion and hormones as her permanent teeth are developing. The so-called temporary fillings, made of zinc oxide and eugenol, are very easy to put in, and are antiseptic and mildly anesthetic topically. (I had them in wisdom teeth, and they lasted for years.) X-rays, anesthesia, and drilling into invisible cavities have their place in especially problematic adult teeth, but seem inappropriate for teeth that will soon be gone.

# Dental X-Rays

**[How to navigate a situation where a dentist feels x-rays are pretty much "necessary"]**
The legal situation "forces" dentists not to rely on their judgment. Mexican dentists, in a different economy, are able to rely on their judgment, and I have known a couple dentists there who demonstrated their ability to skeptics, doing the work first, then making x-rays to show that their eyes and brains had done the job perfectly.

**[Light therapy immediately following x-rays]**
Dentists have always described the x-ray exposure as "very small," but I have never known one who in fact knew how much radiation he was exposing his patients to. In the 1980s I went to a US dentist who didn't object at all when I said I didn't want x-rays. His left index finger was missing, so I knew why his attitude was different. In the ‘60s and ‘70s there was an epidemic of index finger cancer among US dentists, because it had been common for them to hold the x-ray film in the patient's mouth while making the exposure. A study in Seattle a few years ago found that, even with heavy shielding of the whole body, a single full mouth set of x-rays caused pregnant women to deliver underdeveloped babies. For over twenty years doctors defended x-raying pregnant women despite the evidence that it caused leukemia and other childhood cancers. As the practice was discarded, the incidence of childhood cancer decreased. Starting in the 1950s, the US government had a huge campaign to justify their bomb program by convincing the public that ionizing radiation was very safe (Project Sunshine). A typical project the government supported was the Monsanto Research Corporation's proposal for a plutonium-powered coffee pot that would boil water for 100 years without refueling. Our "radiation culture" is crazy.

**[I mentioned how dentists compare x-rays to the sun (like, you would get more radiation from the sun), how dentists say their x-rays are "lower radiation" than they used to be, they're better and digital, etc., how dental hygienists don't go running out of the room now, etc.]**
The comparison to the sun really is simply fraudulent. The only digital thing about the new method is the way the image is recorded and displayed, making the process very quick and much cheaper for the dentist, which is why they like them. But it's the same old ionizing radiation. Hygienists who act like that are just stupid.

**[This is the kind of thing some dentists share if asked about the safety of x-rays: http://www.drplitt.com/dental-x-ray-safety/]**
I would say that page was written by a moron. Otherwise, I would have to say that it was written and posted by dishonest people.
