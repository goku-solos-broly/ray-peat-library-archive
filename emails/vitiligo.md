# Vitiligo

I used a dilute copper solution to restore pigment to my eyebrows and whiskers, but when the solution was too concentrated it produced, within a few hours, a raised pigmented area, so I stopped using it topically. Vitamin D and progesterone favor the survival of pigment cells. I think a topical solution of aspirin and caffeine might be helpful, and is safe.
