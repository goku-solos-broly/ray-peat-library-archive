# Altitude

High altitudes are usually sunny.

**[5,740 feet = 1,750 m]**
That's high enough to make a difference.

**[6,000 feet = 1,830 m]**
I think those moderate elevations are very helpful. My place in Coeneo is only 6600 feet, but my nearsightedness always improves when I'm there for a few weeks. People who are very sensitive to altitude would have a headache at 14000 feet, so that was a good test.

**[6,560 feet = 2000 m]**
2000 meters has a noticeable effect after a couple of weeks, higher is better, but it's necessary to take some time to adapt to the higher altitudes before being very active.

**[How long does it take to reap benefits?]**
During the first couple of weeks, the body usually has stress reactions that have to settle down, then the improvement continues for years. A couple of months at altitude will usually cause changes that last for several months even at lower altitude.

**[What is the lowest elevation, that one could reap good benefits?]**
Statistics for New Mexico showed improvement for every increase of altitude within the state--I think it's continuous, from below sea level up to around 12,000 feet.

**[Are there any conditions which high altitude is negative for? I think I remember saying something about asthma?]**
I should have said respiratory diseases, meaning things like emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Asthma is usually improved at high altitude, above 6000 feet, for several reasons. Even in polluted Mexico City, at 7500 feet, there's very little asthma, but people who vacation in Acapulco often get asthma.

**[After settling in for a week or two, is light exercise OK? Short runs?]**
I think walking should be the main exercise for the first several weeks.

**[Can one really reap the same benefits with bag breathing, and other artifical ways, as they would with actually LIVING in high altitude?]** 
No.
