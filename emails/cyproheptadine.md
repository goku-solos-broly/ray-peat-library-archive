# Cyproheptadine

Cyproheptadine, 2 to 4 mg at bedtime, would help with his sleep as well as the cancer. It also has calcium blocking action, aldosterone antagonism, and antagonizes serotonin's antidiuretic effect.

It's good to start with about half a milligram, at bedtime, to judge its effects when sedation isn't risky.

## TOPICAL USE
It would be hard to regulate the dose via the skin.
