# Politics, History

**[Polititcal power and deception]**
I think understanding political history is essential for understanding culture and science, because the manipulations and deceptions of power are aimed toward total control. I've been aware of U.S. fascism for most of my life, having read Smedley Butler's account of the 1934 coup attempt against FDR, involving DuPont and J.P. Morgan officials and Henry Luce's publications. Their plan was to say that they were taking over because of the president's poor health. Because Butler went to congress to reveal the plot, it was delayed for 11 years. The Dulles brothers managed the US government from 1945 to 1963, and Gladio guided Europe. In 1965 at Blake College, we had a course on the role of the Masons in the politics of Latin America, taught by Iso Brante, who had done considerable research on the subject. At that time, the Sinarquistas were still very active in Mexico. For a long time I have thought of Russia and the west side of Latin America as the places where civilization would have its best chance to escape.
