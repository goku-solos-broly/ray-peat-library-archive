# Diet

Orange juice and other sweet fruits (with very little starch) would be best. The muscle meats and starches don't provide a good balance of minerals and amino acids (high in phosphate, tryptophan, and cysteine, for example). Shellfish provide trace minerals that are often lacking from other foods. Mercury content is high in the big (old) fish, but not in the small shellfish or small fish such as cod and sole. You are probably deficient in calcium, so gradually adding cheese, eggs, and milk could be helpful.

Yes, squid is very good, with selenium, copper, etc. Some people say that goat's milk is good after they have had trouble with cow's milk. The food the animals eat can contribute allergens to the milk. I use pasteurized milk because the dairies in this region with raw milk happen to use feed that give the milk a bad taste. If you think you might have a real milk allergy, you should start with just a drop or a sip. Adding sugar or honey (if you aren't allergic to honey) will decrease any allergic reaction to the milk.

There isn't any MSG in gelatin, but the purity of the product is important. It's best when you extract it yourself, in things like ox-tail soup. Sugar helps the thyroid function, so can improve your blood sugar stability. Hypothyroid people are sensitive to even small amounts of lactic acid, since it tends to deplete the liver's glycogen stores. Squid amino acids are similar to other muscles, but the trace minerals are helpful.

Since cholesterol is the source of progesterone and testosterone (and pregnenolone, DHEA, etc.), and sugar increases it, having fruit rather than starch might increase the hormones. Those hormones, antagonistic to cortisol, can help to reduce waist fat. Chard, collard, and kale are good greens.

Usually the low carbohydrate diets have a high ratio of phosphate to calcium, and I suspect that your present diet does, too. If you powder some eggshells, that's the best way to supplement it, but two quarts of milk per day would be best, providing adequate protein and a safe ratio of P to Ca. Seafood, especially oysters, shrimp, squid, etc., would provide the iodine and selenium you need for good thyroid regulation. Increasing fruits in place of bread would increase blood sugar stability, and would provide vitamin C in a safer form. Taking your temperature before and after breakfast helps to interpret your circadian hormone cycle---hypothyroid people often have very high adrenaline, cortisol, and other stress hormones during the night, causing the temperature to be higher before breakfast than after. A daily raw carrot often helps to balance progesterone, cortisol, and estrogen, by improving intestine-liver functions.

It's best to have more calcium than phosphate, and your diet is deficient in calcium, and heavy on phosphate, and that by itself can cause serious stress. Cheese would be a good way to get enough calcium, if you don't use milk. Eating protein by itself can cause a big surge of cortisol. Preceding the protein with some carbohydrate makes the protein go farther, otherwise under the influence of cortisol a lot of protein is used just for energy. Your diet might below in vitamin A, so it would be better to have eggs for breakfast, preceded with a generous amount of orange juice. Bananas can be seriously allergenic, apples are allergenic for some people, but not as intensely as bananas. Well cooked potatoes, with butter or cream,are a very good way to get carbohydrate, if you aren't allergic to them, because they contain a good balance of amino acids, too, as well as minerals and B vitamins.

I normally use pasteurized (and homogenized) milk, and I know people who do best when they use ultrapasteurized milk, and many people who, especially in certain seasons, don't tolerate raw milk. Cows' bacteria change according to what they are eating, and sometimes even the low level of bacteria in pasteurized milk can upset the person's intestinal balance of bacteria. I advise against eating the solid parts of coconut, as a regular part of the diet, and recommend the deodorized refined oil, because so many people are allergic to the proteins (and starches) of coconut. My November newsletter, below, will explain why people tend to lose weight on milk and sugar.

For a while, the vitamin A is very important, and the PUFA isn't crucial in the short term, so 2 or 3 eggs would be o.k., though in the longer run it's good to eat liver about twice a month, limiting the daily eggs to one or two. The type of cheese doesn't matter much as far as calcium goes. If you don't get much sunlight, and during the winter, a vitamin D supplement is necessary to use the calcium effectively. Plain white rice, well cooked, with butter is o.k. The calcium, vitamin D and vitamin A will greatly improve your immunity,the colostrum wouldn't be necessary.

**[POTATOES]**
The carotene in sweet potatoes can make them harder to digest. Well cooked white potatoes, such as russets, are very nutritious, and the (cooked) juice is just something for people with extreme metabolic or digestive problems. The juicer I had was the kind that's commonly used for juicing carrots, and it was inexpensive. I don't think it was anything near 700 watts, that's nearly a horsepower, more than enough for a big cement mixer.

**[NON-MAGICAL MUSHROOMS]**
Since reading about the chemicals in mushrooms I stopped eating them, but using them occasionally is o.k., probably better than many vegetables.

**[THYROID FROM FOOD]**
Yes, people used to get very significant amounts from fish heads, chicken necks, various stews and sausages. I knew Norwegians who lived in fishing villages and ate fish head soup every week who said all their relatives were healthy into their 90s.

**[POTATOES VS BANANAS: Potatoes can feed bacteria in the gut resulting in endotoxin and serotonin production; bananas contain serotonin -- yet which of the two is the lesser evil?]**
Potatoes are much better, unless you're allergic to them (it usually goes with allergy to tomato and bell peppers).

They **[conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and Butyric acid]** aren't necessary, but the CLA in cream and butter are probably responsible for some of their good effects. I use 1% milk, some butter and hydrogenated coconut oil, to keep polyunsaturated fats to a minimum.

**[Salt cravings]**
There are some very salty cheeses that help to satisfy salt appetite, for example pecorino or feta; sometimes I add salt to cheeses such as gouda, emmental, mozzarella, or cheddar. Sometimes pork rinds, chicharrones, are good for a salty snack; I usually heat them in coconut oil and then drain them, to remove some of the pork fat. Orange juice, guavas, watermelons, cherimoyas, cooked apples, cherries, and ripe papayas are good sources of sugar to have regularly.

**[Low testosterone, high cholesterol]**
The problem with chicken is that the fat is highly unsaturated, and the meat provides very little calcium. Milk and cheese have a much better ratio of calcium to phosphate. Having the carrots raw (shredded, with a little olive oil, vinegar, and salt) would help with the hormone balance, and protect the intestine against inflammation. Supplementing pregnenolone wouldn't have the risk of the DHEA being converted to estrogen, which tends to happen when thyroid function is low. A small supplement of Armour thyroid or the equivalent could quickly lower the cholesterol, and since cholesterol is converted by thyroid into pregnenolone and DHEA, that would probably help the testosterone. Some shellfish (oysters, shrimp, squid, etc.) or low fat fish would provide trace minerals that might be lacking in your diet. Several eggs per week, or liver once a week, can help with other nutrients that are probably deficient in your present foods. Well cooked potatoes, with butter or cream, fruit, and well cooked greens are other foods have vitamins and minerals that are helpful.

## Meal Frequency
Small meals help to increase the metabolic rate, single big meals increase fat storage.

There are just occasional intervals when I'm not eating---cafe con leche several times a day, other things in between.

Frequent meals are helpful during hypothyroidism, and help to prevent obesity, but when the thyroid and liver are working, 2, 3, or 4 meals are good. For me, 2 meals and some snacks are most convenient. Orange juice is good by itself.

Yes, as the metabolism gets more effective, you don't have to eat as often as when you are starting to change. At first, when glycogen isn't being stored, temperature will rise and fall situationally.

## Fiber
Cellulose is the safe fiber, and (boiled) bamboo shoots are another safe fiber. My May newsletter, below, has some information about the effects of other fibers, including pectin. If the fruits don't cause digestive problems, such as gas, then the fiber is good. Apples and pears are often so fibrous (because of incomplete ripening) that the fiber can be harmful.

**[About Fiber]** They aren't necessary, for example milk supports abundant bacterial growth that creates bulk, but when there are digestive and hormonal problems because of bad intestinal flora, the fibers of carrot and bamboo shoots have a disinfecting action. The carrots must be raw for that effect. 

**[Fiber-free diet possible?]**
I've had a fiber-free diet for many years.

## Macronutrients (carbs, proteins, fats) and their ratios

When starch is well cooked, and eaten with some fat and the essential nutrients, it's safe, except that it's more likely than sugar to produce fat, and isn't as effective for mineral balance.

Starch is less harmful when eaten with saturated fat, but it's still more fattening than sugars.

People can do well on high or low fat or carbohydrate, but when the carbohydrate is very low, some of the protein will be wasted as fuel, replacing the missing glucose.

I have often had a gallon of orange juice in a day, with 100 grams of other sugar, and didn't see any problem, even while being sedentary. If your metabolic rate is high, with a pound of sugar you will still have an appetite for quite a bit of fat and protein.

That depends on your size, metabolic rate, and activity, and the other nutrients, but I sometimes have more than that [400 G OF CARBOHYDRATE], including the sugar in milk and orange juice (and I'm about your size, and very sedentary). The fructose component of ordinary sugar (sucrose) helps to increase the metabolic rate. I think a person of average size should have at least 180 grams per day, maybe an average of about 250 grams.

Sugar helps the liver to make cholesterol, switching from starchy vegetables to sweet fruits will usually bring cholesterol levels up to normal. If the fat is mostly saturated, from milk, cheese, butter, beef, lamb or coconut oil, I think it's usually o.k. to get about 50% of the calories from fat, but since those natural fats typically contain around 2% polyunsaturated fats, I try to minimize my PUFA intake by having more fruit, and a little less fat, maybe 30 to 35%.

If your temperature increases quickly after eating, that's good. I often eat a kilogram or more of oranges in a day, 150 grams of sugar per day wouldn't be excessive.

The fats in meat and cheese can be minimized by choosing low fat types, and skimmed or 1% milk can be used.

**[How much starchy food is safe?]**
There isn't enough information to judge, but a fair part of the carbohydrate should be in the form of sucrose, fructose, and/or lactose. If it's well cooked, and eaten with butter, it's probably safe for many people.

**[How much sugar?]**
Appetite should be the basic guide. When your liver has enough glycogen stored, sweet things aren't appetizing.

Although we can make our own fats from sugars, I think it's good to have some fat in our food, because of its effects on the intestine especially. Experiments on an isolated loop of intestine, measuring the nutrients entering the bloodstream, showed that relatively simplified mixtures of nutrients were poorly digested. Fat, protein, sugars, and minerals, in combination, activated the intestine, increasing the digestion of all of them, when they were present at the same time. If the fats are mostly saturated, as in butter, coconut oil, or beef or lamb fat, roughly a third of the calories is good, but the ideal proportion probably depends on the specific foods and the person's level of activity. Increasing either fat or sugar can have some specific therapeutic effects, but when more information becomes available about the composition of particular fruits, I suspect that the ideal balance of nutrients will lean toward the sugars, supported by ketoacids and short-chain saturated fats. The polyunsaturated fatty acids, which break down into toxic fragments and free radicals and prostaglandin-like chemicals, are--along with bacterial toxins produced in the intestine--the source of the main inflammatory and degenerative problems. Sugar and the minerals in fruits are fairly effective in keeping free fatty acids from being released from our tissues, and the fats we synthesize from them are saturated, and aren't likely to be stored as excess fat, because they don't suppress metabolism (as polyunsaturated fats and some amino acids do). The minerals of fruits and milk contribute to metabolic activation, and prevention of free-radical damage.

**[AMOUNT OF FAT EATEN PER MEAL TO ACTIVATE THE RANDLE CYCLE, EVEN IF IT'S SATURATED]**
It's mostly from large fat meals, at first, but then it is increased by stress, and builds up over time. 

**[NAUSEOUS AFTER HIGH FAT MEALS]**
Diabetes tends to interfere with the activity of thyroid hormone, and low thyroid function is closely connected to gall bladder problems. It's important to have some carbohydrate with protein foods, to prevent decreased blood sugar symptoms.

**[GRAVITATING TOWARD HIGHER FAT RATIO]**
Increased metabolic rate could increase fat appetite.

**[HIGH FAT VS HIGH CARB]**
Because of the harmful effect of PUFA, I think it's good to keep all fat intake somewhat low, because even butter and coconut oil contain about 2% PUFA. Fruits and vegetables have sugar in a good balance with the minerals needed to metabolize it.

**[40 Grams of fat a day enough?]**
I think that's enough, having a little with the other foods is best.

**[Do you think someone eating 5000cals and 8g pufa is equivalent to someone eating 2500cals and 4g pufa; both being weight stable]**
I think so.

**[Minerals and Vitamins]**
I think it's good to choose foods with a high ratio of calcium to phosphorous. Supplementing calcium (and often vitamin D is needed too) is usually necessary with the typical modern diet.

## Ray Peat's Diet

Over the years I averaged a gallon a day, and I liked to eat butter, fat meat, ice cream, and thick cream in my coffee, so 1% milk had enough fat. I didn't like the taste of skimmed milk, and the available 1% happens to be pasteurized. In Mexico when I get it from the farmer, I don't know how much fat it has, but on average it's probably similar.

I used to drink at least a gallon of 2% or 3% milk daily, and often ate more than 5000 calories, but when I'm completely sedentary for more than ten hours daily, my energy requirement is much lower. The calorie intake should be balanced to your heat production and activity.

I find that I need almost a pint of orange juice to balance one egg.

Our foods usually contain enough PUFA, unavoidably, to make fats matter to some extent. After about twenty years of carefully avoiding them, I'm still getting about 2% of my fat as PUFA (beef, oysters, eggs, etc.). That's why I'm making an effort to increase my sugar intake, to displace some fat.

Eggs and orange juice, milk and oysters, and a raw carrot. For variety, smoked oysters, crab, cod fried in butter, ox-tail soup, parmigiano reggiano, sapotas, lychees, liver. Completely avoiding unsaturated fats, such as canola and mayonnaise, and minimizing beans, cereals, and vegetables.

Normally, I usually have around 400 grams of carbohydrate. I have about 3 quarts of milk, varying amounts of orange juice (probably over a quart on average), eggs, and about 200 grams of meat or fish, with other things such as coca cola, cheese, ice cream, cheese cakes, some coconut oil and butter, occasional tropical fruits.

**[GLYCINE SOURCE]**
I occasionally use some powdered gelatin for things like making marshmallows, but usually I get my gelatin from soup, such as ox-tails. lamb shanks, or chicken backs and wings."
