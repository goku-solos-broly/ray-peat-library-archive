# Bath, Washing, Shower, Sauna, Jacuzzi

Warm showers can lower stress, and if the bath isn't too warm, it's effective, too; if the bath raises the body temperature, that can cause the metabolism to increase, sometimes causing low blood sugar.

A sauna or hot bath, by increasing your metabolic rate, can quickly deplete the glycogen in your liver, causing hypoglycemia. If you eat protein without enough sugar or other carbohydrate it can cause hypoglycemia, too, so it's important to have lots of orange juice and milk, for frequent snacks.

## Jacuzzi and hot tubs
Getting the body temperature too high can deplete glycogen and lower blood glucose, sometimes causing fainting, probably why people occasionally drown in hot tubs; high temperature can damage the testes, reducing sperm production.

## Fluoride in showering/bath water
I don't think it's a problem. The soaps and shampoos people use are worse problems. Just washing the skin with pure soap alters the skin's endocrine function for days. and doing it every day is an "endocrine disrupter," even if there are no toxic additives in the soap.

## Shower with a little instant coffee: feeling, looking better
Some caffeine can be absorbed through the skin, but caffeine is a diuretic, so you probably aren't absorbing enough. Do you drink coffee with your meals? ## Yes. I still don't know what it is doing in my body.
It might be from the cafestol and kahweolâ€”they are fat soluble and well absorbed by the skin.
