## Povidone iodine for recurring skin infection? High blood pressure
It isn't good to repeatedly cover a very large skin area with iodine, but it's safe to use on small areas. 10% sulfur soap is another safe disinfectant that works on various types of infection. There are some nutritional deficiencies that can cause recurring infections. Vitamin D deficiencies are very common, and predispose to all sorts of immunity problems. Hypothyroidism and vitamin A deficiencies sometimes lead to prolonged infections, and increased TSH is very closely involved with high blood pressure.

## Skin problems worse on a diet for increasing metabolism
Vitamins and trace minerals have to increase proportionally as the metabolic rate increases.
