# Menses

**[Cramps]**
Have you seen effects on your temperature and pulse rate from the Cynomel? The need for T3 increases premenstrually, and is probably greater with diabetes.

**[Contraceptive pill for heavy periods]**
Hypothyroidism is the basic cause of heavy menstruation. Things strong enough to kill an embryo can't be harmless to a person.

**[Irregular cycle - When to take progesterone?]**
If you know the date of the last menstruation, you could go by the calendar, so 6 or 10 or 14 days later might coincide with the ovulation cycle; if you have a sensation of ovulation, that would be a signal to start it, or if you see a sudden rise in morning temperature that could indicate ovulation. But if there's no cycle you can detect, just starting the progesterone could renew the rhythm.

**[Premenstrual Syndrome]**
Premenstrual stress suggests that the thyroid function is low, at least during that time. Do you eat liver and shell fish occasionally? The trace nutrients in those sometimes make a difference.
