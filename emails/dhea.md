# DHEA

It's very common for people in their forties to become deficient in both pregnenolone and DHEA, but occasionally it happens in younger people, usually because of an imbalance of thyroid and estrogen. In women, too much DHEA can have a masculinizing effect, so it's best to work on the diet, or to use pregnenolone, which doesn't lead to an imbalance between progesterone and DHEA, since it turns into either, according to need.

Ten milligrams of DHEA is pretty safe for men, the most common side effects are pimples, oily skin, and sex dreams.

If your thyroid is very low, you should be cautious with the DHEA, because stress hormones can cause it to turn to estrogen. 5 mg of DHEA taken with a little olive oil or butter can have a noticeable effect on your mood and muscle tone in a few hours.

**[Oral or topical use?]**
Orally.

**[DHEA, type 1 diabetic]**
If thyroid function is good, and inflammation is low, about 5 mg of DHEA is probably safe, but I think pregnenolone and cynomel would probably be as effective.

**[15mg DHEA and 5mg testosterone every day for a woman?]**
DHEA and testosterone at those doses are likely to grow whiskers. 5 mg. of testosterone is about ten times what a woman produces in a day, and is about what a muscular young man produces. (Reference)

**[Dosage]**
Its production decreases fairly steadily with age, from a daily maximum of 12 to 15 mg in the teens, to nearly zero at 90, so supplements of 5 to 10 milligrams are usually safe for middle aged people. 

**[Conversion to estrogen]**
Thyroid and other antiinflammatory things (even aspirin) help to prevent conversion to estrogen.

**[Would a ratio of 2:1 (pregnenolone Â : DHEA) help mitigate DHEA conversion to estrogen, given no more than 15 mg of DHEA is ingested in a day?]**
Yes, I think pregnenolone can protect against stress and conversion of DHEA to estrogen; larger quantities would be o.k.
