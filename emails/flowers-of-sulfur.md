# Flowers of Sulfur

Flowers of sulfur, USP (or precipitated sulfur powder) can be mixed with a little water and applied topically to eliminate yeast... since the yeast live in water, they can interact immediately with the sulfur when it's in water.

I used a pinch, less than a sixteenth of a teaspoonful, putting it on my tongue and washing it down, just 3 or 4 days in a row. But a daily raw carrot is usually as effective, and can be used continuously.

I think the first safer thing would be flowers of sulfur for about 3 days, then the herbs **[wormwood, black walnut hull and cloves]** if you don't see results with the sulfur.
