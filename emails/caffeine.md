# Caffeine

Caffeine increases your metabolic rate, so it's important to take it with food, including enough sugar. Coffee and cocoa are very good magnesium sources. Cocoa contains both bromocriptine and caffeine, bromocriptine seems to be more stimulating to the heart than to the brain.

## Do you think it is safe to use caffeine tablet of 600 mg or more to treat fatty liver?
That would be too much caffeine at once, unless it's with a big meal to slow its absorption.
