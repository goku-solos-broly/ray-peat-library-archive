# Seafood

## What is the best/safest way to cook seafood? I would assume boiling, steaming or frying in coconut oil.
Those, or butter.

## Is the quality of seafood, or other foods, a concern after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, for someone living in the West Coast? Could it have become irradiated and pose dangers to health?
Yes, sea food from the northern Pacific should be tested periodically, but the US government has stopped the radiation testing that had previously been done, which I think means that the radiation is exceeding their previous safety limits.
