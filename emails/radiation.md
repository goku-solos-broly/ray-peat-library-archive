# Radiation

**[AIRPLANES & RADIATION]**
Not likely. The biological effects of radiation decrease as altitude increase. LET and mesons explain the relationship.

**[SHIELDING THE HOUSE]**
The radiation from telephones and such can be blocked by wire mesh, that's well grounded. Some people use screen to cover the walls and ceiling of their bedroom, grounding it by attaching it to the plumbing, or to the electrical ground wire. A metal roof that has a wire or metal drain-pipe connecting it to the ground reduces the radiation from radio and television. Much of the natural earth e.m. resonance will be excluded.

**[You mentioned that "A millionth of a gray is known to produce BYSTANDE EFFECTS." Do you have any studies suggesting this?]**
I don't remember the context, but it probably referred to in vitro experiments, in which alpha particles produce very large bystander effects with very little energy. A slight disturbance of cell water activates nitric oxide synthesis, and that interacts both directly and indirectly with many things, including reduced energy production and destabilization of DNA. Martin Pall and others have shown that millimeter waves, too, can interact with cell water and increase nitric oxide, suggesting that some of their effects will be the same as those of ionizing radiation. An article by Betskii and Lebedeva says millimeter waves are being used therapeutically in Russia, so the harmful effects that Pall and others describe apparently aren't immediately apparent.
