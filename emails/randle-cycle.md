# Randle Cycle

## Coconut oil protected animals from poison-induced diabetes, yet Randle described the inhibition of glucose oxidation by free fatty acids. I'm trying to reconcile the above two facts; is coconut oil exempt from becoming free fatty acids and competing with glucose in the randle cycle?
Relative to PUFA, yes. When the body contains a lot of PUFA, eating coconut oil increases oxidative metabolism, partly because of the shorter fatty acids that are more quickly oxidized, like sugar, and partly because of the antimetabolic effects of the PUFA that they displace. More recently, several investigators have found that a "deficiency of essential fatty acids" is highly protective against diabetes.
