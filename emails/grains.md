# Grains

Masa harina (best), white rice or oats, and brown rice. The phytic acid in the oats block absorption of much of the calcium; cooking the oats much longer than usual might improve its nutritional value.

## Sourdough bread
Naturally fermented sourdough is less harmful than standard or unleavened wheat products, but any starch tends to stimulate appetite by activating fat synthesis. The same number of calories in fruit would be less fattening, and would keep your blood sugar steadier, improve your sleep and mental energy.

## Millet Flour: goitrogen
It's only a diet dominated by goitrogenic foods that's a problem, small amounts don't have noticeable effects.

## Can white bread cause intestinal irritation and endotoxins?
Yes, white bread is usually artificially leavened, and so contains unmodified starch and gluten.

## Follow up: okay to eat on occasion or is it likely to cause allergic reactions if gluten sensitive?
Yes, it's definitely a problem for people who are sensitive to gluten. Home-made bread, that's soaked for about 12 hours during leavening, is much safer than the typical commercial bread.
