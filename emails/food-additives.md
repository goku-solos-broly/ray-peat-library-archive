**[Citric Acid]**
I'm looking for one without the citric acid. The benzoate isn't necessary with a lot of added sugar, but it's probably used everywhere.
 
**[Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (Hypromellose)]**
I think it's good to avoid it when possible; there's an article by Gerhart Volkheimer, on persorption, that explains how particulate matter of all sorts can enter the blood stream from the intestine.
