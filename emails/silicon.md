# Silicon

**[Value for connective tissue health]**
I don't think silicon is safe, or has value as a nutrient.

I recommend many foods containing considerable amounts of silicon, such as meats, liver, shell fish, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms, but there are many products on the market that contain silicon in forms that can be harmful.
