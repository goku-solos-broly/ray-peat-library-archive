# Satiety

**[Not satisfied with orange juice and milk]**
Coconut oil (I prefer hydrogenated) helps satiety, while tending to increase the metabolic rate. Cheese can be especially satisfying, partly because of the flavor. Sometimes trace nutrient deficiencies lead to over-eating; liver, oysters, and cooked mushrooms can satisfy appetite without high calories. Sometimes hypothyroidism, a tendency to hypoglycemia, is responsible for weight gain.
