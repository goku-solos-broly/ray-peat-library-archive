# Hiatal Hernia

## Symptoms include: chest pains, chest and throat tightness, shallow breathing, occasional palpitations, constant heartburn, bloating, asthma-like symptoms
Have you had blood tests for hormones? The whole complex of symptoms including hiatal hernia is usually caused by a general weakness of digestive and hormonal processes, and it's especaily important to check thyroid function carefully, with a blood test and recording waking and midday temperature and pulse rate, and average caloric requirement.

It is most likely to develop as a result of reduced thyroid hormone and increased stress hormones (especially cortisol, in relation to testosterone and DHEA), weakening connective tissues. Some foods that cause intestinal irritation can make it worse; a simplified diet makes it possible to identify any specific foods that make the problem worse. Keeping a record of temperature and pulse rate can help to recognize any hormonal problems."
