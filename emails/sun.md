# Sun

**[ZINC OXIDE LEAST HARMFUL SUNSCREEN]**
Yes.

**[Considering that aspirin works in some ways like niacinamide, would niacinamide help prevent sunburn?]**
I haven't tried niacinamide for sun protection; the fact that it can lighten skin pigment might mean that it's blocking some free radical processes.

**[Sun damaged skin]**
Topical vitamin A with vitamin E would be protective. Progesterone and caffeine are other powerfully protective things. Both caffeine and progesterone are protective topically as well as orally.

**[ASPIRIN]**
It's protective against sun aging, like vitamin E. I think the most helpful thing for wrinkles is pregnenolone (internally), since it increases the tone of connective tissues, causing the fascia and similar tissues to contract, if they have been sagging from a metabolic energy problem (caused by accumulated PUFA).
