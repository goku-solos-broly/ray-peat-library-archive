# Receptors

**[Alternative to 'receptors']**
There are proteins that bind chemicals while those chemicals are producing effects on cells, but the schemes that use them to explain cell physiology are very ideological, usually arbitrarily excluding many alternative explanations. In some cases, they are fraudulent, in others, just stupid, but usually important for the drug industry. I think it's valuable to investigate the development of the estrogen receptor idea by Elwood Jensen.
