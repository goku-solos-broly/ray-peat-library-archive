# Aspirin

I don't know anyone who has a stomach reaction when they dissolve the aspirin in hot water, and then take it with food. There are alternatives, such as magnesium salsalate or just plain salicylic acid (which should be used dissolved and with food). People using it with cancer usually take a daily total of 6 grams or more. Vitamin K protects against bleeding and other effects of prolonged aspirin use.

I mostly use the pure crystals, but in Mexico I use the Bayer tablets.

If the aspirin smells like vinegar it's decomposing, otherwise the expiration date doesn't matter. I have some aspirin, USP, that's at least 10 years old that's still good.

USP aspirin from any source is usually good. I buy it by the kilo.

When aspirin and niacinamide lower the temperature I think it's because they lower the stress hormones.

## Cancer
I think a little aspirin, regularly if not daily, is good prevention, if you are sure to get enough vitamin K, to prevent excess bleeding. The amount depends on how you react to it, and can change as your metabolism adjusts. Taking some at bedtime can be very helpful for sleeping; sometimes I take about 500 mg at night, but other times just a little. I think the crystals are more stable, but I keep the big container (a multi-year supply) in the freezer, and keep out enough for a couple of months. The powdered forms developed an acetic acid smell with time, the crystals don't.

## Dose
It depends on the context; aspirin makes you need more vitamin K, even when you aren't using much. People who use aspirin for arthritis or cancer often take several grams a day.

7000 mg is a lot, and it's very important to take vitamin K with aspirin.

People sometimes take that much aspirin attempting suicide, but I don't think that's relevant to a conclusion about antinociception.

## Use of Aspirin in bath
Some therapists have advocated it.

## Starch in aspirin tablets problematic?
Only if it causes symptoms such as hemorrhoids, asthma, or headaches.

## Safety of animal aspirin
They sell aspirin, USP, for animals, which is the same as used for people, except that it doesn't contain the toxic additives of the tablets.

## Aspirin allergy
I know people who had lifelong "aspirin allergy" who now use it regularly. I think part of it is the metabolic problems caused by PUFA and low thyroid function.

## Safe upper limit?
It depends on the context; aspirin makes you need more vitamin K, even when you aren't using much. People who use aspirin for arthritis or cancer often take several grams a day.

## Right dosage of aspirin for use as anticoagulant?
Clotting time must be measured when taking any anticoagulant.

## Aspirin prior to surgery? (testicular cancer)
If vitamin K is used generously, aspirin wouldn't be likely to cause a bleeding problem. Progesterone could be used to lower luteinizing hormone before surgery, if that's high. I think tetracycline (or a derivative) would be helpful to use with the aspirin. It's important to check thyroid function and vitamin D.

## Aspirin smells like vinegar. Is it safe?
It breaks down into salicylic acid and acetic acid, and both of those are safe.
