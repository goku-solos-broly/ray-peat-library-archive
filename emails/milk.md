# Milk

I think it's a matter of watching for any effects associated with a particular product; if nothing is obvious, the fresher milk is preferable.

Reduced milk is o.k. if the heat wasn't very high.

## PROBLEMS WITH MILK

I know people who tolerate only the ultrapasteurized milk. What about cheeses?

Yes, I think bowel irritation is behind milk sensitivity.

I have been interested in the subject of "milk intolerance" for a long time, and have wondered why doctors in the US and England give it so much attention, while the people who drink the most milk, in the Samburu and Masai cultures, and the cultures of northern India, don't seem to have the problem. I doubt that this is a matter of genetic differences; for example this person: "I was recently diagnosed with lactose intolerance and so i had to eliminated milk and milk products from my diet. I live in the USA. However, on a recent trip to India, I had milk and all possible milk products there and it did not affect me at all! Has anyone else experienced this? Or does anyone have a possible explanation?"

When a woman or a cow eats an allergen, such as peanuts or soybeans, the allergens appear in the milk. Weeds in the pasture are another potential source of tainted milk. In Africa and India, milk production per cow is much lower than in the US, because they seldom give them anything but grass, or in India, hay, probably some fruit. Although insecticides such as lindane are no longer used in US dairies, most of the milk in commerce has synthetic vitamins (dissolved in corn oil) emulsified into the product, which could account for many of the bad reactions.

Goat milk contains more copper than cow milk, and copper is important for energy metabolism and blood formation.

**[RAW OR PASTEURIZED MILK]**
The difference isn't enough to worry about. 

**[HOMOGENIZED MILK]**
It's o.k. 

**[ESTROGEN IN MILK]**
High estrogen, relative to progesterone, interferes with lactation, and the enzymes that convert estradiol to the less active estrone and estriol are increased by progesterone. The amount of estradiol in milk is usually much less than one microgram per liter, and it's concentrated in the cream, so low-fat milk has very little estrogen. The cow's diet is probably a more important factor in the estrogen content of milk than pregnancy. The information in that abstract isn't enough to tell whether the study was done properly.

**[Powdered milk]**
It's not as good as fresh milk, or cheese, but when they aren't available, 100 grams (or more) would be a good addition to the diet, because of the high ratio of calcium to phosphate, as well as other nutrients.

**[Lactase milk, brand contains less than 1% of Lactase enzyme]**
I think the lactase milk is safe."
