# Acacia Gum

## On Acacia Powder/Acacia Gum/Gum Arabic
Yes, acacia gum is very allergenic. It has taken me two or three weeks to get over symptoms from it, when I accidentally got it in a food. But other irritating foods might keep the symptoms going, so it's good to watch for changes with different foods.
