# Autoimmune Diseases

## Do high level of Thyroglobulin Antibodies and Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Antibodies show autoimmune thyroditis?
When TSH is too high for a long time, it causes inflammation in the gland, and the antibodies are in reaction to that.

## Type 1 diabetic with TPO antibodies
Was your TSH tested? Usually the antibodies just mean that the thyroid gland is inflamed, and increased TSH can be responsible for that. T4 can suppress TSH protectively, but since intracellular glucose is needed for making T3, diabetes can interfere with that. I think some T3 is always appropriate with diabetes. [TSH was 3.9] I think the high TSH explains the antibodies, and a combination of T4 and T3 is usually all that's needed; it usually takes a few months after suppressing TSH for the antibodies to decrease. Cortisol would be important to know, also estrogen and prolactin would be more informative than the common thyroid tests.

## Autoimmune diets
Have you seen my website article on milk? It mentions some of the things behind gluten sensitivity. Hypothyroidism is one thing that commonly causes leaky gut, as well as leaky liver, muscles, heart, thyroid gland, etc. The immune system reacts to the leakiness, and although it might be an effect, rather than a cause, the presence of antibodies is sometimes said to show autoimmunity.

## Test for cross-reactive foods
The presence of specific antibodies means that someone has been exposed to an antigen, but it doesn't indicate that they will react badly to it.
