# Coconut

**[Coconut meat]**
It often causes gas and irritation symptoms.

**[Coconut water]**
If it is fresh from the coconut, it's good, also if it has been bottled without additives.

**[Coconut fiber: If it lowers cholesterol (study), does it also lower estrogen?]**
Do you know how the fiber is manufactured, and from what? Fibrous foods can lower both absorbed cholesterol and estrogen, but some fibers are broken down by bacteria to produce estrogenic materials. The husk fiber, coir, is being sold as a food additive. I don't know whether coir has been tested for the release of lignans, which could be carcinogenic. If it's just dried coconut meat, the problem would probably just be gas from the starches. 

**[follow-up: I have cooked finely shredded coconut meat with some sugar and I have used it occasionally and it works a lot like carrot salad for me but there was some mild gas problem.]**
I think gas is the only problem from the mature meat.
