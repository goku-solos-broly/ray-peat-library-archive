# Methylfolate and methyl B12

## Bad reaction
I think it's risky to supplement methyl donors in substantial quantity, such as choline, betaine, methionine, and S-adenosylmethionine.

The amount of methyl in that form of B12 is so tiny that I think it's more likely an allergic reaction; folic acid is allergenic too, and the slightly different manufacturing processes could account for different reactions to different products.
