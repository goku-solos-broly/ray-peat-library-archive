# DHT

The special difference between testosterone and DHT is that testosterone is easily aromatized into estrogen, and DHT isn't. There are several ways that the body can dispose of estrogen, but I haven't heard of that way of inactivating it; I don't think it happens in the body.

I think it was the drug industry, thinking of villains [DHT=BAD] to justify their otherwise crazy treatments.

I haven't heard of any bad effects from DHT, but that might be because it's so rarely used. The liver problems I've heard about have always involved slightly modified molecules. I think the tendency to take too much might be a problem with androgens generally--4 milligrams of testosterone and 15 mg of DHEA is a normal daily production for young men, and half of that amount is effective for middle aged men, unless the problem is something else. 

A little DHT should be safe, but I don't think mesterolone is safe in any quantity.
