# Dilated Pupils

I would emphasize milk and orange juice, and some salty things, such as consomme or pork rinds (both with a lot of gelatin). Over a period of a few weeks, it helps the thyroid, pituitary, and liver to adjust. If the thyroid is low, estrogen is slow to be eliminated.

Temperature and pulse rate are important to watch; when the stress hormones are lower, they will increase after breakfast, and stay up until late afternoon.

The temperature rise during the day is the most important thing, since nocturnal stress hormones can give a misleading impression in the morning. Resting pulse rate is another good indicator. Milk and cheese are the best calcium sources.

Adrenaline can increase to compensate for low thyroid function, and causes pupils to dilate. Thyroxin by itself works when your liver is in good condition, supplied with enough glucose, and not stressed by adrenaline and other stress hormones. Something that contains both T4 and T3 is better for getting out of a stress pattern. Armour thyroid or Novotiral might work better than Eutirox. Too much of the weed interferes with liver function, and while it's recovering it's necessary to be careful to get enough protein and other nutrients every day, for example orange juice, eggs, milk, cheese, cooked mushrooms, occasional shellfish.
