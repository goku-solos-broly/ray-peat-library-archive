# Alcohol (or Cannabis)

Have you ever had a thyroid test or tried a thyroid supplement? High serotonin activity is often presentin hypothyroidism, and alcohol can probably provide temporary compensation for that.

Small amounts of alcohol can have some good antioxidant effects, but beer, wine, and dark whiskey, etc.,contain enough estrogen to be harmful.

People have very different reactions to it, probably depending on thyroid activity. It can have anantioxidant effect, but it can also cause hypoglycemia with pro-oxidative effects. If a person eatspolyunsaturated fats, alcohol is more likely to cause oxidative reactions between iron and the fats.

## WODKA
No, it is likely to increase the absorption.

Heavy drinking inhibits cellular respiration and sets up an inflammatory process, involving iron, whichwill still be harmful, but less so than in the presence of PUFA. If absolutely none of the dietary PUFAwere in the body, no one really knows what that metabolic stress would do, maybe nothing cumulative.

## Least estrogenic?
Pure colorless highly distilled alcohol is the safest. It can have antioxidant effects, but in somepeople it can interfere with the respiratory enzymes and lower blood sugar. Fructose is protectiveagainst some of its toxic effects.

## Alcohol and cannabis? What is the best immediate measure to mitigate any harmful effects you see inthese two drugs?
Small amounts of alcohol can have some good antioxidant effects, but beer, wine, and dark whiskey, etc.,contain enough estrogen to be harmful. Cannabis is antiandrogenic or estrogenic, but it can beprotective in some situations. Protein, thyroid, sugars, and saturated fats are protective against both.
