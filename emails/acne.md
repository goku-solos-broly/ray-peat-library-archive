# Acne

Have you tried anything topical, such as sulfur, or an antibiotic such as minocycline? 10% sulfur soap leaves an antiseptic residue on the skin that can prevent infection.

I think it would be good to try the sulfur soap first.

Vitamin A affects the differentiation of skin cells, the production of steroids, and resistance to infection and inflammation. The great increase in formation of the sex steroids at puberty increases the need for vitamin A, and makes its regulatory actions more important. Thyroid's important functions for the skin are the production of steroids and preventing their imbalance, and maintaining the immune function and production of sebum. Other nutritional deficiencies, especially the balance between vitamin E and unsaturated fats, affect the functions of vitamin A and thyroid, so it's important to include foods like liver, eggs, oysters, fruits, and milk in the diet. Sometimes it's easier just to use Benadryl or minocycline to reduce the inflammation and infection.

A solution of aspirin in water on the skin helps with the inflammation, and is mildly germicidal.

ZINC isn't directly an oxidant, but when it's used as a chemical supplement it can cause problems that it wouldn't in the form of foods. Both vitamin A and zinc are essential in the right amount for good skin health, but too much of either can disturb the immune function. Irritation of the intestine is often involved in skin problems, and supplements always contain trace contaminants that can cause reactions. When ADM bought Distillation Products from Eastman several years ago, the composition of their vitatmin E products went through several changes, and competing companies began making similar changes. Since then research results haven't been as consistent as they were 40 to 60 years ago, and I stopped recommending amounts up to a few hundred units per day, waiting to see more results of research. Some of the products sold as vitamin E now contain significant amounts of PUFA, and lack some of the substances such as octacosanol that were in traditional products. The right amount of thyroid is essential for skin immunity and metabolism of steroids in the skin. Topical anti inflammatory things such as tetracycline and aspirin often produce the quickest response.

ANTIBIOTICS can be used topically, but the tetracycline type is usually taken internally, for their antiinflammatory effect. Changing the diet while using an antibiotic can make the effect permanent. 

**[Can FLOWERS OF SULFUR taken internally help with acne? Would minocycline also help?]**
Either of them can help, but with prolonged use the intestine can develop sensitivity to the sulfur. causing irritation instead of stopping it.

**[Why do many women get rid of acne using CONTRACEPTIVES (estrogen)?]**
Estrogen causes the oil glands to atrophy, so the skin doesn't support bacterial growth so well. Topicalsulfur's germicidal effect can help, and topical aspirin and caffeine are antiseptic as well as antiinflammatory. One function of vitamin A is to increase progesterone in the skin, and it has to be inbalance with thyroid to do that. Another function is to differentiate the skin cells, reducing keratinplugging of the glands.

**[Best topical form of tetracycline for acne?]**
I think the easiest thing would be an over-the-counter neomycin lotion.

**[BENZOL PEROXIDE]**
I suspect that it will age the skin. Have you tried topical sulfur and oral tetracycline? 

**[follow up: Tetracycline safe when pregnant?]**
Antibiotics generally shouldn't be used during pregnancy. Sulfur (precipitated or sublimed) can be mixed into a slurry with water and patted onto the area. Dissolved aspirin used with it increases the antiseptic effect and reduces inflammation.

**[follow up: Is BRIMSTONE POWDER safe?]**
The people who wrote the label should be removed to fresh air immediately, their brains aren't getting enough oxygen. There are forms of sulfur that are ground, rather than precipitated, and they aren't as effective, but they aren't harmful. If it has a very strong smell, it might be contaminated; the smell should be mildly unpleasant. Ground sulfur/brimstone is commonly used in animal feed, so it isn't toxic. 

**[Does the precipitated sulfur smell like a match also?]**
Yes, the smell varies slightly. When there's a skin fungal infection, there's a hydrogen sulfide stink, which is what kills the fungus.
