# Light

Incandescent bulbs have a continuous spectrum, luminous gases have intermittently distributed wavelengths. Orange and red are the metabolically most important wavelengths. I don't think the far infrared does anything special, besides heat. Ordinary incandescent bulbs have a slightly orange color compared to sunlight, and the bulbs I have mentioned are just slightly warmer in color, with very little blue, and more red. Ordinary incandescent bulbs are good, if there are enough of them, directed toward your skin.

It does suppress melatonin. I think the problem with light research is that many of them weren't using similar levels of light energy at the different wavelengths. I have tried sleeping with red light, and I didn't like it; but it can be equally effective, for maintaining blood sugar or reducing inflammation, if it shines only on the feet or legs. I think the u.v. lamps are good for use in the winter.

During the night all of the hormones of stress and inflammation rise, and the ice cream decreases them enough for you to stay asleep, but they still rise. Having more very bright light (several hundred watts of incandescent bulbs) in the hours from sundown until bedtime will lower them a little more. Since T3 is used up very quickly, allowing the proinflammatory TSH to rise during the night, it would help if you used Cynoplus at bedtime, instead of Cynomel. If you were taking 10 mcg of cynomel, then a third of a tablet of cynoplus would provide that, as well as the T4 that holds the TSH down longer. Having an egg every day, and liver once a week, will help to balance the effects of the thyroid hormone, which increases your need for vitamins, especially vitamin A.

I use them (incandescent light bulbs) for keeping my area warm, instead of centrally heating the house. My view of the energy saving light bulbs is that putting a cork in the plug saves more energy (and doesn't contain mercury).

Having a larger proportion of your fat near bedtime often helps to get through the night without inflammation.

It varies with the season, but 8 to 8 1/2 hours is usually best.

Brighter light in the early evening [reducing night-time stress]

Blood sugar falls during the night, causing inflammatory mediators and adrenalin, etc., to increase. Sleeping with a wool cap and stockings can help. Having plenty of sugar just before bedtime, or if you wake during the night, will usually alleviate the night-stress problems.

**[Does red light repair damage done just by U.V. light, or maybe also by X-rays?]**
By any irradiation, but it's most effective within the first hour.

The harm from the radiation can be interrupted most effectively right away, before the changes have been amplified and integrated with the system.

**[Blue light reducing oral cancer growth]**
Plain incandescent bulbs have enough of the red spectrum to work. Blue light is slightly toxic, so like ultraviolet is can slow cell division, but its toxicity also causes inflammation. Red light reduces inflammation, but it tends to increase proliferation.

**[Proximity of light]**
If it's comfortable it isn't harmful, but it's easy to get burned when they are so close. Your body temperature is likely to rise, otherwise I don't know of any problem from prolonged light (but even incandescent light does have some slightly harmful blue light, so you should watch your own reactions to it).

**[Does it matter where the bright light shines on your body to receive beneficial effects?]**
Bare skin is best; for effects on the nervous system, shining on head, face, neck and back is good.

**[Does infrared light and red/orange light also increase the need for vitamin A?]**
Not as far as I know.

**[LCD screens]**
People react differently to different screens. Keeping the room bright, and the screen not too bright, can reduce the eye strain. This person has very detailed information about them: http://www.conradbiologic.com/articles/SubliminalFlickerI.html

**[As I add more and more incandescent lights to see how I feel, is there an approximate number of watts which is prudent to not go over?]**
The heat is the limiting factor, not the light.
