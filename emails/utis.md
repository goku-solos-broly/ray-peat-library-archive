# Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)

Slight hypothyroidism is a very common cause of chronic urinary infections. Both thyroid hormone and progesterone increase the (IgA) antibody production on membranes, improving resistance to infection, and they reduce the resistance to histamine, which tends to increase in the bladder under an excess of estrogen. Checking temperature and pulse rate in the morning and middle of the day is helpful as a first way to check for possible hypothyroidism.
