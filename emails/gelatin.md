# Gelatin

For most people it's o.k. to eat it undissolved, but it causes gas for some people.

I usually cook the ox-tail with just enough water to cover it, for about four hours, until the meat comes off the bone easily. It makes a very concentrated gelatin solution.

I haven't had experience with Knox gelatin, I have mostly used either Great Lakes or Gelatin Innovations brands, which are economical by the pound. When I'm not sure of the origin of the pork, I heat the pork rinds in coconut oil and then drain the oil off, to reduce the PUFA.

Beef gelatin is available from Great Lakes; some people say they have trouble digesting the pork gelatin. Because the pork rinds contain a lot of fat, which in pork is highly unsaturated, I re-heat mine in coconut oil and then drain them well, to reduce the amount of polyunsaturated fat. Since the polyunsaturated fats interfere with energy production and promote inflammation, I think it's better to avoid them. (They interfere with thyroid and progesterone, and activate estrogen production.)

## GELATIN-RICH MEATS
Lamb shanks, pigs' feet, various joint bones, and boiled chicken, if the fat is skimmed off.

## FLUORIDE IN GELATIN
The only analysis of gelatin that I have seen showed very little fluoride. Since most of the fluoride in an animal is concentrated in the bones, and gelatin is made from skin, it probably doesn't contain much.

## How long to cook broths?
It's mostly for the attached cartilage, ligaments, and tendons, and most of the gelatin is released in 3 or 4 hours. Excess cooking oxidizes nutrients, especially if there's marrow in the bone.

## Safety of using chicken carcasses
In the US, chickens are fed arsenic to make them grow faster, and it concentrates in the bones; you should find out what the chicken feeding practice is in your area.

## Peat's gelatin sources
Mostly I get gelatin from things like ox-tail soup, but I use a little gelatin from Great Lakes Gelatin.
