## TOPICAL PREGNENOLONE IN VITAMIN E COMPARED TO PROGEST-E FOR WOUND HEALING
Yes, probably better for most things.

Topical baking soda, honey, and granulated sugar can be helpful for wounds.

## What is the mechanism behind the effect of silicone-sheets for reducing hypertrophic scars?
I had a good experience with reducing a scar by coating it with viscous vitamin E. I think trapping CO2 is probably the main effect of the silicone.
