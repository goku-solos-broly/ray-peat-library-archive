# Hemorrhagic Fevers

Ebola infection seems to involve a lack of interferon, and the amount of nitric oxide in the blood increases in proportion to the intensity of the symptoms. Reductive stress/inflammation that activates interleukin-1 and arachidonic acid metabolites can inhibit interferon, and at the same time increase the production of nitric oxide. Resistance would be improved by oxidative and antiinflammatory things.
