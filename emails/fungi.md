**[On whether the amount of fungi related toxins (considered high in some studies on coconut oil) is of concern in coconut oil and coffee.]**
Since animal studies show good health effects of both of them, and bad effects of other foods such as peanuts, wheat, and corn, the contamination is probably low. Hexane extraction seems to eliminate it, and it apparently declines in stored oil with time.
