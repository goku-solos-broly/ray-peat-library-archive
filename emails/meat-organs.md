# Meat and Organ Meat

## (Muscle) Meat

Meat contains too much phosphate, which destabilizes everything, and energy depletion has similar effects.

In the US, there is a widespread meat cult, that insists meat should be stored for two weeks before it's sold; it's convenient for the corporations that want everything to have an indefinitely long shelf-life, but it's bad for the public health. 150 years ago, when refrigeration was rare, the 'high' flavor of meat was considered to be good, and people who were used to eating the half rotten stuff shaped the meat culture, and people looked for a 'scientific' rationale for keeping meat in storage until it lost its fresh taste. The rationale is that it becomes tender, as the enzymes cause the meat to digest itself. That process starts after the glucose and glycogen in the muscle have been depleted, and the collagen and other proteins begin to be degraded. Besides losing the amino acid balance of fresh meat, the products include the cancer-promoting polyamines. Liver contains far more of the self-digesting enzymes than muscles do, and its glycogen is depleted in just a few hours. This is why liver in the US tastes so terrible. Since liver and eggs contain many of the same essential nutrients in high concentration, and eggs don't digest themselves, that's why I eat a few eggs in the US, despite their known high content of PUFA. When I can avoid the PUFA, I do; and in Mexico, liver and other meats aren't stored, except maybe in the supermarkets that serve foreigners.

**[Bacon]**
The nitrate isn't likely to be a problem if you eat it with orange juice. I fry the bacon to remove some of the fat, and then refry it in coconut oil, to remove most of the PUFA.

**[Cooked meats]**
But the juices from inside quick cooked meat inactivate those toxins; the inside should be pink. Milk, cheese, and eggs are better proteins, anyway, because of the better calcium/phosphate ratio.

## Liver

Yes, two to four times a month.

I cook it quickly in butter.

**[If avoiding milk and minimizing eggs intake, can you get enough vitamin A & D just from beef liver?]**
Yes, beef liver has so much of the oily vitamins that it just takes an occasional meal to meet those requirements generously. The charts have stopped giving its vitamin E content, and rarely mention vitamin K, but it's very good for those. Charts still don't reflect the intracellular (lipid soluble dehydro-) form of vitamin C, but liver is a good source of that too.

**[LIVER POWDER]**
No, it's just bad tasting dry meat.
I made extracts myself, and there was a lot of it, but I didn't measure it exactly, just a few milligrams per kilo.

**[Alternative to liver]**
A combination of eggs and oysters would cover the main nutrients, but not as well.

**[Liver/oysters once a week versus every day - is it just convenience?]**
Convenience, because of the time preparing things.

**[Do you think Argentina Liver Powder is okay for supplementing Vit B6?]**
Probably, but the dehydration probably damages it nutritionally.

**[Vitamin E content of liver is low in USDA data]**
Overcooking destroys many nutrients. The vitamin E content is much lower in grain-fed beef than in grass-fed.

**[How much is safe?]**
I think six ounces a week is enough, and safe. Drinking coffee with it reduces iron absorption.

## Other Organ Meat

Brains do contain beneficial steroids, but the other fats aren't necessarily good, so I don't recommend them especially as an isolated food.

**[Do you have any misgivings about eating beef kidney once a week?]**
Yes, I never smelled one that I wanted to eat.
