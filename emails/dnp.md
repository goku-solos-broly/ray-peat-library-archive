# DNP

The toxicity of DNP was known from the beginning of the 20th century. The cataract epidemic came on suddenly in the spring of 1935, probably because of a product with a larger dose. The cataracts caused by DNP appear within a few hours or days of taking the drug, and disappear spontaneously when the drug is stopped, more quickly with vitamin C supplement. The FDA used the cataract outbreak to get new powers. The production of permanent cataracts by estrogens and glucocorticoids hasn't led to any action at all by the FDA.
