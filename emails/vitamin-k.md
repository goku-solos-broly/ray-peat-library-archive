# Vitamin K

K1 is probably a little less active than K2.

**[MK-4 vs. MK-7]**
Taking the vitamin with a meal, it will absorb slowly and steadily, and I don't think will make much difference.

**[Â±25g of spinach and 5-10g of beef liver enough to counteract blood thinning effects of aspirin]**
I think that amount of liver and spinach is likely to be enough.

**[Baby Aspirin]**
Vitamin K is good for protecting muscles and bones, so 500 micrograms to one milligram is good anyway, and it would be protective against even more aspirin.
