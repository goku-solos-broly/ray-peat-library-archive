## Genetic Dogma

**[Mainstream science beliefs: What is right and what is wrong?]**
Some of the basic ideas about the mechanisms of energy production are mistaken, for example that glycolysis is controlled by random diffusion, and the chemiosmotic theory of mitochondrial phosphorylation, but there's still useful information available regarding the bigger picture, looking at the "energy charge" and the ratios of oxidized and reduced molecules, for example. Cancer involves a shift in the direction of reduction—an idea that has been around for over 60 years, but kept in the background by the genetic dogma. Oxidative metabolism shifts the balance away from cell multiplication, allowing specific functions, and so allows an organism to recover from cancer. The doctrine that cancers are genetically mutated cells justifies the standard treatments—surgery, radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy—intended to kill 100% of the mutant cells. The problem is that the damaged region where the tumor had been is left in a reductive state, and signals the organism for repair cells, and those become abnormal when they enter the region of destruction. Cancer mortality figures have been manipulated to convince the public that the standard treatments produce a certain rate of cure, but cancer deaths have increased parallel to the increased number of people treated. For example, the biggest surge in prostate cancer deaths came in the 1990s after the discovery of the prostate specific antigen, PSA, which greatly increased the number of people receiving treatment. In the 1950s, Dan Mazia and Albert Szent-Gyorgyi were showing how the reductive condition of a cell relates to cancer; Frances Knock was another person working in that direction. In just the last few years, there are signs that this approach is coming to the foreground of biological research. But it can't be officially acknowledged, because it would reveal the carcinogenic and irrational nature of the standard treatments.

## Breast Cancer

Orange juice and guavas contain aromatase inhibitors, and aspirin and progesterone are other inhibitors. Aspirin and progesterone also oppose the effects of HER2/neu on aromatase and estrogen. (Reference)

## Eye Melanomas

I had some probable melanomas years ago, and I found that progesterone and DHEA and increased thyroid caused them to disappear quickly. 

His other symptoms are very suggestive of a deficiency of pregnenolone, progesterone, and thyroid, as well as the vitamin and minerals. Once when I had four ounces of beer daily for a few weeks several moles grew rapidly, and I realized it was probably the estrogen in the beer that was responsible, and two weeks after I stopped the moles dried up and fell off. Orange juice contains naringenin which is effective against melanoma, and guavas contain apigenin, also effective. A diet consisting of milk, orange juice, guavas, cheese, and some eggs, liver, and oysters, with aspirin would be protective against the spread of the tumor. Thorne's high potency vitamin K drops would help with the blood pressure, and vitamin K also has some anticancer activity, and is necessary when you use a lot of aspirin. At least 15 milligrams per day would probably quickly regulate his blood pressure.

Pregnenolone isn't a hormone, but it normalizes the steroid hormones, preventing excess cortisol and helping to normalize aldosterone, so it should be helpful for any stress including surgery. Progesterone has a wide spectrum of anticancer activity, but as far as I know only synthetic progestins have been used medically. Although I used myself it on things that appeared to be very active melanomas, I usually recommend a slightly hyperthyroid state for helping to control it.

## Glycine & Cancer
They are forgetting the organism and the liver and gluconeogenesis, and the glucogenic amino acids. They are approaching the issue of cancer metabolism from the perspective of "cancer genes." Cancers have multiple ways to convert the body into fuel to support their growth.

The interesting thing about that article is that 10 people working at Harvard and related institutions would choose to do a Science- Fair-suitable project; I'm not surprised that the AAAS magazine would publish it, since it doesn't clash with the doctrine of cancer as the result of mutated genes. For about 70 years, the cancer establishment denigrated Warburg for commercial reasons. The present use of his name by mainline researchers for immature ideas about cancer physiology shows the quality of biomedical education in the US and Europe.

An enzyme that activates glycolysis, PFKFB4, is normally increased by oxygen deprivation and the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), but it is also increased by heme oxygenase (Li, et al., 2012). Gluconeogenesis is normally inhibited by heme, which is removed by heme oxygenase. Lactic acid produced by glycolysis activates an enzyme (thioredoxin) that increases cellular sulfhydryl reduction, and increases HIF and also stimulates the formation of new blood vessels by inducing VEGF, the permeability and growth factor which is essential for the growth of cancer, and which is induced by heme oxygenase. While interfering with the functions of mitochondria, heme oxygenase also stimulates the growth of new mitochondria, along with new blood vessels.

## Lung Cancer
Lung cancer cells produce increased amounts of some things that promote abnormal growth, and some of these can be inhibited by common harmless materials. The effects of adenosine and (leaked) ATP are inhibited by caffeine, prostaglandins are inhibited by aspirin and pregnenolone, estrogen by progesterone, aromatase inhibitors, orange juice and cooked mushrooms, histamine and serotonin by antihistamines, cyproheptadine, nitric oxide by tetracycline, progesterone, agmatine, etc. Emodin, in cascara, blocks various things in lung cancer, and its laxative effect helps to lower nitric oxide, histamine, and serotonin. 

## Skin Cancer
Yes, avoidance of unsaturated fats is the most important thing. Aspirin, caffeine, and orange juice are protective. Keeping the TSH low is important, because it stimulates melanoma growth.

**[Topical fluorouracil for skin cancer]**
About 6% of the fluorouracil is absorbed systemically.

## Tongue Cancer
Besides large amounts of aspirin (grams per day), and vitamin K1 or K2 to prevent abnormal bleeding from the aspirin, I think I would use DCA (dichloroacetate), which is available from Canada on the internet (and forums describe its use), and maybe an enzyme related to vitamin D, called GCMAF, that activates the immune system.
