# Coconout Oil

If you are using coconut oil regularly, that's a possible source of allergens, if it isn't well refined anddeodorized.

Most cities have wholesale grocers that either stock it (in five gallon buckets) or can get it, and theyusually charge about $50 per bucket. GloryBee in Eugene is one place I have bought it, and TropicalTraditions has a good one, called expeller expressed, non-certified, and I think it's shipped from Nevada.

It's just filtered, usually through diatomaceous earth, to remove materials other than the fat; the mainproblem with the unfiltered oil is that it's allergenic for many people. It also degrades quicker.

**[MCT OIL]**
The problem lots of people have is diarrhea or other bowel reaction when they take more than a very smallamount at a time. The first times I used it I smelled like a goat for several days, and even a small amountis enough for me to notice on my skin the next day.
