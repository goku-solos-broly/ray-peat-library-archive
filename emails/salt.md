# Salt

A friend had the celtic salt analyzed, and found it was high in toxic heavy metals. The pure white common salt is best.

That standard isn't very strict, but the salt is probably safe, if it's white. I usually use either La Baleine or Morton's canning and pickling salt.

Some sea salt is refined, by sequential evaporation, until it's very pure; either kind of pure white salt without additives is good.

## PARACHUTING SALT?
The salt might be causing problems used that way.

## ALTERNATIVE SODIUM SOURCE
Baking soda in water is helpful for some people.

## UPPER LIMIT
Too much salt can injure the stomach. Appetite is usually a good guide to the amount needed.
