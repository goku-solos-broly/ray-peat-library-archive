# Fruit Juice

A few other juices **[other than orange juice]** are good, for example watermelon. Some fruits contain things that affect the hormones.

**[PASTEURIZED FRUIT JUICE]**
Usually they are o.k. 

**[Concentrating juices to reduce fluid intake]**
Milk and fruit juice are osmotically balanced with minerals and sugar, so they don't cause imbalance of body fluids, the way drinking plain water can in a hypothyroid person. Many doctors have recommended drinking a certain amount of water every day, regardless of thirst, and that often causes problems in people with hormonal problems.

## Apple Juice

Apple juice can be very good, but much of it is made from spoiling apples, so there's a risk of fungal content.

**[How to know if it's free of fungal contaminant?]**
There are probably flavor indications, but I don't know whether anyone has studied that.

**[Is there any other problem with apple juice besides starch and pectin?]**
It looks like there isn't much fiber in store bought apple juice.

## Orange Juice

Citric acid binds magnesium and calcium, and if the orange juice was sour (commercial juice usually has added citric acid) that might account for the blood pressure change.

If oranges aren't sweet, straining it won't prevent irritation.

Until 2006 I was using mostly frozen pulp-free concentrate, then they introduced the enzyme process (for disposing of waste fiber, making it stay suspended in the juice), affecting even the 'pulp-free' type. So now I use only sweet oranges that I squeeze myself. US people don't realize how ridiculously degraded their standard of living has become. Nutrition is political economical. The governments tell people to eat beans and bread for a reason. I use coca cola as a fill-in when I can't get oranges.

**[Cooking orange juice to reduce fluid intake]**
Part of the value of sweet orange juice is its antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antiestrogenic effect, and cooking will change those effects to some extent. What would be the reason for reducing fluid intake?

**[Do you think canned not from concentrate juice is ok or should it be avoided?]**
If it's in glass it might be o.k. Even the so-called pulp-free juices now might have been processed with enzymes to liquefy pulp.

**[What about commercial pulp-free OJ in a plastic container like florida's natural brand?]**
If it separates into an orange-colored sediment and a nearly clear supernatant, it's probably natural, but even the so-called pulp-free juices now often contain the enzyme-solublized pulpy refuse."
