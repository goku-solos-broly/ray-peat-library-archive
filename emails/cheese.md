# Cheese

When the label says 'enzymes,' it is likely that they are using one of the new products; lots of people are having serious intestinal reactions to commercial cheeses. Real animal rennet is still safe, as faras I know. Industrial grade citric acid is a serious allergen for some people, because it contains contaminants that aren't in natural fruit citric acid, but it's probably safer than the industrial 'enzymes.' The producers of the enzyme products claim they are highly purified, but some people react asthough they still contain some antigens from the microorganisms. The traditional cheeses were made with milk that soured with the bacteria that lived in the cows, but now it's common to sterilize the milk, and then add cultures, or enzymes, or citric acid, for standardization---but they often put their faith in a commercial product that seems to work well, but that could have serious allergenic contaminants. The same thing has been happening with aged cheeses, many places are no longer letting the native molds infect the cheese curds. Homogenizing doesn't cause any problems---unless they use solvents/detergents for adding the vitamins A and D that are required in milk with reduced fat. The vitamins aren't normally added to whole milk or cream.

## TRYPTOPHAN CONTENT OF CHEESE
It varies a little with the method of making cheese, and the calcium content varies even more. 

The calcium content of ricotta cheese can vary greatly, depending on whether the whey is separated by acid or by bacterial proteolysis.

The ratio of calcium to phosphate is more important than the absolute amount of calcium. 4 ounces of Parmegioanno Regiano would usually be enough.
