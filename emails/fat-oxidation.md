# Fat Oxidation

**[You said that fat oxidation is best left to the muscle at rest, since this is their preferred fuel. Wouldn't taking substances like niacinamide and aspirin interfere with the muscles' ability to oxidize fat?]**
Aspirin increases oxygen consumption; although niacinamide can reduce excessive lipolysis, I don't know whether it would lower resting lipolysis.
