# Headaches and Migraines

## Migraines
Lots of sugar, without coffee, would be quicker for restoring blood sugar. At least a quart of milk shake or ice cream can provide the needed sugar in a form that can be assimilated quickly. 100 mg of progesterone in oil can usually stop it, by stopping the wastage of glucose.

## Headaches from supplements
Have you tried a large oral dose of progesterone? A very large amount of sugar will usually relieve a migraine; ice cream (about a quart) or milk shakes with some fat and protein make it easier to assimilate the sugar without stomach upset. Caffeine sometimes makes the aspirin and sugar more effective. Did any of the magnesium chloride get on your lips? In my own migraine experience, I found that a very small amount of either vitamin A or magnesium chloride could cause big headaches for two or three days. If I had put vitamin A anywhere on my face or arms, enough would touch my lips to cause the headache. It wasn't the vitamin A or magnesium itself that did it, but some very powerful allergen in the chemically manufactured products. It's possible that some such substance has entered the T3 during its manufacture, so using a different brand might avoid the effect. What brands of T3 and desiccated have you used? Is cyproheptadine available where you are? It's probably the safest of the antiserotonin drugs; here are some articles about it.

I think prolactin and TSH would be worth checking. I have had bad headaches when I used vitamin A orally, and even getting a little on my lips was enough to do it. It could be that the Nutrisorb-A was the cause, if you used it orally. I use it only on my legs and feet.

## Headaches and shakiness
An inefficient liver that, among other things, doesn't store enough glycogen to last the whole night, is a common cause of both headaches and shakiness. Lots of light exposure to the whole body helps to increase metabolic efficiency. Liver and oysters about once a week, while keeping stress low, have nutrients that help with liver efficiency. Cyproheptadine, a small amount at bedtime, reduces night stress, might help the headaches and shakiness.

Low blood sugar increases the absorption of toxin from the intestine as well as activating nerve reflexes and inflammation, so keeping the intestine active and clean with mild fiber, and blocking inflammation with aspirin and antihistamine, is usually helpful.

The herbs can irritate the intestine, and I know someone whose liver function was worse while she was taking milk thistle--it's good to be cautious with them.
